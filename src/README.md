#Java Best Practices assignment


>>1.The code snippet below, can throw a NullPointer exception. Give reason how it can throw a null pointer exception and what would be the best practice to avoid null pointer exception for such cases.                                                                                                                                                                       5

		public static void main() {
                               
			private  String compareStringValues(String value) {

				if(value.equals(“MOM”))
					return “MOM”;
				else
					return “DAD”;
            }
        System.out.println(compareStringValues(“MOM”) + “cook food for me”);
        }

>>2.Code to iterate over a list of string and get only non empty and non null string is given below:	                                                                                                                                                                   5


                 public static void main(String[] args) {

        		         List<String> collection = new ArrayList<>(
                                                    Arrays.asList("A", null, "B", null, "C", "", "D"));
 
                                Iterator<String> i = collection.iterator();
                                while (i.hasNext()) {
                                    String s = i.next();
                                    if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) {
                                                    i.remove();
                                     }
                                }
                        System.out.println(collection);
                }
    >>>Instead of using for loop or while loop use stream API and do it in a functional way.


>>3.When can a Java class be marked as final? What does it mean when a class is marked as final?											5

>>4.There is a function called processOrder which takes 6 parameters. Is it a good practice? If not, give the reason and what would be the best practice to follow?			5
processOrder(String customerCode, String CustomerName, String deliveryAddress,BigDecimal unitPrice, int quantity, BigDecimal discountPercentage)

>>5.What is the correct way to check empty strings according to you and why?		5
public boolean isEmpty(String str) {
return “”.equals(str);
}
public boolean isEmpty(String str) {
return str.length == 0;
}

>>6.In the below code snippet, there is a security concern. Identify it and give reason.	

    public static void main() {
                               
        private  boolean authenticate(User user) {
 
		    LOGGER.info(“authenticate user {}”, user)
                                   
            return “User1”.equals(user.getUserName) &&  “checkPass”.equals(user.getPass));	
			
        }
    }



>>7.The below code snippet results OutOfMemory or reason for memory leak in the application. Give reason Provide the best solution to avoid memory leak for such cases.
                
                public void readStream()
                throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
                    String str = "";
                    URLConnection conn = new URL("https://blog.knoldus.com/").openConnection();
                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
                    while (br.readLine() != null) {
                    str += br.readLine();
                    } 
                }


>>8.Can we catch Throwable? Is it recommended or best practice to catch Throwable? If not, give a  valid reason with an example.
   
        public void catchThrowable() {
            try {
            //do Somthing
            } catch(Throwable t) {
                //do somthing
            }        

        }

>>9.Write a program in Java to Print characters and their frequencies of a string  in order of occurrence.                                                                                                                                                                      25

    Input: programming
    Output:  p1r2o1g2a1m2i1n1
    Note- a)  Use efficient or best suited  Java Collection framework interfaces and classes.
    b) Use functional programming  means avoid use of for, while, do while loop.

>>10.Write a program in Java to implement a simple dictionary with few letters/strings and print it in alphabetical order.	  

    Note- a)  Use efficient or best suited  Java Collection framework interfaces and classes.
    b) Use functional programming  means avoid use of for, while, do while loop.
