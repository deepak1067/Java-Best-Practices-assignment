>>Answer3:- The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being subclassed. If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from the final class.
Example
final class Super {
    private int data = 30;
    }
public class Sub extends Super{
    public static void main(String args[]){
    }
}
>>Answer4:-You can use any number of arguments in a function in java. There is no standard limit to have this number of argument in function in java. [As per I know] IMO as a practice you should not have more than 4 arguments for a function but this is not the standard you can have any number of arguments.
